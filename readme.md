# jpylyzer gui
This gui builds on [jpylyzer](https://github.com/openplanets/jpylyzer). Jpylyzer runs on the command line

Jpylyzer gui allows you to check one jp2 file one at a time, via a gui. If you get the binary from bintray.com (see 'Downloads' below) you can even use jpylyzer gui without having to install Python.

## How to use
### If you have Python 3 installed
Just run jypylyzer-gui.py and follow the instructions on the buttons.

1. Select jp2 file
2. Select or create a folder
3. jpylyze

Your output file will be in the folder you selected in step 2.

### If you don't want to install Python

1. Select jp2 file
2. Select or create a folder
3. jpylyze

Your output file will be in the folder you selected in step 2.
